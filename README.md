# PIG GAME PROJECT

## Description

An exciting game involving two players players take turns to roll a die until one reaches a minimum score of 100

-    Initially, each player has a total score of 0
-    In each turn, the player continuously rolls the die and the resulting face value is added to a running sum
-    Turns are switched in two cases: the active player decides to hold or the die's face value is 1
-    If the player holds, the running sum is added to the player's total score
-    If the die's face value is 1, the running sum is not added to the total score
-    Whenever the turns are switched, the running sum for each player is reset back to 0
-    First player to reach at least a total score of 100 wins the game

## Credits

This project was completed as part of an Online Course on Udemy titled
**_The Complete JavaScript Course 2023: From Zero to Expert!_** The game's
user interface and rules were both designed by the course instructor, **Jonas Shmedtman**, and
students had to implement the game's logic using Javascript. Still, Jonas guided students all the
way through the implementation by providing walkthrough videos. Therefore, I would like to thank
Jonas for his tremendous commitment to his students and for giving us this great project.
